title: Text Santa

layout: posts

intro: ITV's annual fundraising appeal aimed at giving hope at Christmas by raising money and awareness for selected charities and causes.

desc: Since 2011, more than Â£32 million has been raised in support of 25 different charities. Text Santa was ITV's way of encouraging viewers to make a difference at Christmas. Text Santa was one of my main projects at ITV. I was the main point of contact for all brand, digital and design requests, working with internal stakeholders and external partners. It was an exciting diverse role with many tasks; from designing and developing the campaign website, through to overseeing photo shoots, social media planning and managing the creative development of asset production with a small team of designers.
